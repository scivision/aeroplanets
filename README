Trans++: a C++ implementation of the Trans* programs.
_____________________________________________________



To run, it needs the boost libraries > 1.5
                     ______________________

To create the documentation, it needs doxygen and graphviz.
                                      _____________________

To use the "plotte" plotting utility, you must have python and pylab 
(python-matplotlib) installed, and you must have a graphic access to
the computer that run this program (it can be through a ssh -X session).





The installation process is standard,  (autotools,) and is explained in ./INSTALL

Some usual configurations are listed in  ./DifferentConfigurations

#>make check 
may give some errors on the newest version of boost.


When the program is compiled and installed. You can go to data/Earth 
and run 
#>aero1d AuroraEarthFairbanks.xml
Then, you can go to SortieAurora and use #> plotte (if copied in the bin directory) to plot the different outputs.
SortieAuroraCompar is pre-computed and allows to check if the compilation/computation was successful.


=======================================================

To create the documentation, the ./doc directory must be here.
Then, run $doxygen Doxygile the ./doc must then have an "html" and a "latex" directory.

To browse the configuration with an internet browser, open
./doc/html/index.html

To have a pdf document, go to the latex directory and type make.
If you have the good latex libraries, it will create a refman manual.
