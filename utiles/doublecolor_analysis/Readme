In this folder, there are several tools to launch a double-color analysis.

================================== Launching the simulations
First, the create_launchfile.py, (which uses powerlaw.py), is used to create a CIGRI-like launch file.

The create_launchfile is intended to be edited before creating a file.
The "dico" dictionnary gives the option to be modified, and a list of values for that option. (The options should be valid in ../launchxmlaero.py since it is this program which will be ultimately called.)


When the script is ready, it should be launched as 
create_launchfile.py templatename outdirname launchfilename

The launchfilename can be launched with e.g. cigri, launchfile_alacigry.py.
Technically, each line of this file will be executed using launchxmlaero.py.

================================= Analysing the simulations

launch_analysis_better.py

This systems aims at analyzing the results of the previous simulations.
It is also intended to be edited (notably the function ptype_study).

It reads the command file, used to create the simulations, to create a database that will be searched for the analysis. This database will the be re-used (that's partially why you should launch this simulation in the directory where the results are; the other reason is because it looks for spectrum.out locally for the color analysis).

The results are read in spectrum.out + number (number given by the simulation).

For now, it does not analyze the Monte-Carlo simulations...
