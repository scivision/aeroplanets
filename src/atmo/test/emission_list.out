# Informations about the emissions
Number: 0 : 	============= Emission nb 0 =============
================================================ N2(A3Su+) VK
 Computation of the emissions of the Vegard Kaplan bands
 This reactions also set up the N2(A3Su+) density used in O(1S) computing 
 When this reaction is called, it fills the N2(A3S_ density in the chem list
 It allows for the other emissions to use that density (eg O(1S) emissions)


Number: 1 : 	============= Emission nb 1 =============
================================================ O(1S)
 Computation of the emissions of O(1S) - 557.7 nm and 297.2 nm
 The reaction uses the Frederick/Kopp O2+ + N -> O(1S) + NO+ 
 It is negligible for the dayside, but must be checked for the nightside

 When this reaction is called, it fills the O1S density in the chem list
 It allows for the other emissions to use that density (eg O1D emissions)


Number: 2 : 	============= Emission nb 2 =============
================================================ N(2D) 520nm 
 Computation of the emissions of the 520 nm
 This reactions also set up the N(2D) photoequilibrium 
 The longlife of the N(2D) state can be a problem for the validity of the equilibrium.
The validity of the reaction N(2D)+O2 -> O(1D) is questioned in Link 91: it may not exists.
Number: 3 : 	============= Emission nb 3 =============
================================================ O(1D) 630nm 
 Computation of the emissions of the 630 nm triplet
 This reactions also set up the O(1D) photoequilibrium 

Number: 4 : 	============= Emission nb 4 =============
================================================ CO(a3Pi) bands around 200nm 

Number: 5 : 	============= Emission nb 5 =============
================================================ CO2+(B) doublet at 289 nm 

Number: 6 : 	============= Emission nb 6 =============
================================================ CH(A2D) band around 420-440 nm 

Number: 7 : 	============= Emission nb 7 =============
================================================ O+(2P)
 Computation of the emissions of O+(2P) - 732.0 733.0 and 247.0 nm
 When this reaction is called, it fills the O+(2P) density in the chem list
 It allows for the other emissions to use that density (eg O+(2D) emissions)


Number: 8 : 	============= Emission nb 8 =============
================================================ O((3p)3P)
