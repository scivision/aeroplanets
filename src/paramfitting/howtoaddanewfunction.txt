To add a new function in the adjustement system, several things needs to be
done:


1) Add the function in math/umathfunction.cpp and math/umathfunction.hpp


2) When you know which parameters to modify, and which to get from the model,
you can modify the files in atmo

3) In atmo/atmo.cpp modify the function InitIonosphere and ResetElectronDens

4) In atmo/neutralatmo.cpp modify ReadParameters and ResetSpecieDens

5) You can now modify the files in paramfitting

6) Adjustement::Adjust (read the parameters)
7) RunAtmoLsq::Exec (the execution)
8) Adjustement::ApplyModif (the same)
9) Adjustement::FillReport (the report about your work)
